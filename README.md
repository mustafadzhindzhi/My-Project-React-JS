# MyCar
This is a WEB application using React for the front-end - an app for bulgarian landmakrs. Used Softuni Practice server for back-end.
I have developed a comprehensive car dealership website, offering customers a seamless experience to either purchase a new car or submit details about their current vehicle. Our platform conducts expert appraisals and presents customers with a competitive price for their cars. Additionally, users can list their vehicles for sale, specifying the desired price for potential buyers on our site. Beyond facilitating buying and selling transactions, we extend our services to a trusted workshop. Customers can conveniently schedule car services through a dedicated page, accessing information about available appointment times. With personalized accounts, our customers enjoy the convenience of managing their listings, making edits, and removing vehicles from sale whenever needed.
